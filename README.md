# ChatApp
This is my Android Project. I will be making a simple chat application, similar Messanger, WhatsApp etc. The idea is that a person will enter the app either as a guest or log in with their account and hold conversations with other users in the app. The requirements are as follows:

MUST HAVE:

The app must have the option to let the users sign in with their account.

The app must have the option for users to send and receive messages to and from other users privately.

SHOULD HAVE:

The app should have a list in which all the other registered users are being displayed. 

The app should allow the users to change their profile image

COULD HAVE:

The app could have the option for the registered users to edit their profile with their personal information, like name, age, email etc. 

The app could have the option for registered users to set their status as online or offline. 

The app could have the option for registered users to send friend requests to each other.

The app could allow users to use emojis.

The app could have the option to show recent conversations a user previously had with others.

WON'T HAVE:  

The app won't have support for voice messages or videos/gifs.
